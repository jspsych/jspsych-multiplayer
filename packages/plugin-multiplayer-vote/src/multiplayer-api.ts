/**
 * Local, structural mirror of the jsPsych multiplayer API surface this plugin uses.
 *
 * The real API is `MultiplayerAPI`, which jsPsych flattens onto `jsPsych.pluginAPI`. It ships in
 * jsPsych core via https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/pull/3694, which is not yet released — so the
 * published `jspsych` type for `pluginAPI` does not carry these members. Rather than take a
 * build-time dependency on an unmerged fork, the plugin codes against this minimal interface and
 * reaches the real object with one cast (`pluginAPI as unknown as MultiplayerApiLike`). The cast is
 * the single seam to re-verify once #3694 lands.
 *
 * Like `plugin-multiplayer-choice`, the anonymous-vote trial is a barrier-then-reveal trial: it
 * collects this participant's ballot, pushes it once (`push`), then waits (`wait`) until the group
 * has voted. It declares `participantId` and `get`, needed to read this client's own slot and push
 * its vote back without clobbering other keys (`push` REPLACES the whole slot). `subscribe`/
 * `communicate` are not declared: the reveal renders once, from the barrier snapshot.
 *
 * Mock-based tests implement this same interface, so the plugin is exercised end-to-end with no live
 * group session.
